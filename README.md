Project Overview 
The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of web scraping for collecting structured, publicly available real estate data in an ethical and efficient way. 
The scraped metadata (titles, descriptions, links) is stored in  a CSV file and can be explored interactively through a Streamlit dashboard. 

Tech Stack 
Python 3.x
BeautifulSoup - HTML Parsing and Data Extraction 
Requests - HTTP requests to fetch web pages
Pandas - Data Organization and CSV storage 
Streamlit - Building an interactive front-end 

Features 
1. Automated extraction of real estate datasets from data.gov.
2. Ethical scraping (only public metadata, no personal data)
